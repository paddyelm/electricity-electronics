# How to read a resistors strips

## 3 - 4 band resistors

On the resistance colour chart
strip 1 & strip 2: you must take the number in the band column
strip 3 is a multiplier, here you multiple by the multiplier band column
strip 4 is the tolerance band, indicates how inaccurate the resistance calculation is. If there is no tolerance band, the tolerance will be 20%.

```
Example
strip 1 - brown
strip 2 - black
strip 3 - red
strip 4 - gold

look at the resistor colour code chart
brown 1
black 0
red x100

1 0 x 100 = 1000 ohms = 1 kilo ohm

-----------------------------------

Example
brown
black
orange

look at the resistor colour code chart
brown 1
black 0
orange x1000

1 0 x 1000 = 10 kilo ohms

-----------------------------------

example
yellow
purple
red

look at the resistor colour code chart
yellow 4
purple 7
red 100

4 7 x 100 = 4 700 = 4,7 kilo ohms

-----------------------------------

example
brown
black
green

look at the resistor colour code chart
brown 1
black 0
green x100 000

1 0 x 100 000 = 1 mega ohm

-----------------------------------

example
brown
black
black

look at the resistor colour code chart
brown 1
black 0
black x1

1 0 x1 = 10 ohm

-----------------------------------

example
brown
black
red
gold

look at the resistor colour code chart
brown 1
black 0
red x100
gold 5%

1 0 x100 5% = 1000 of 5% is 50 ohms = range 1050 - 950 ohms
```

## 5 band resistors

These are persision resistors.
Strip1, 2 & 3: you must take the number in the band column
Strip 4 is a multiplier, here you multiple by the multiplier band column
strip 5 is the tolerance band, indicates how inaccurate the resistance calculation is. The kit seems to only include brown tolerance resistors which have 1% tolerance.
If you are unsure which side the strips start from, use your multimeter to measure the resistance across the resistor.

example
Blue
Grey
Black
Orange
Brown

look at the resistor colour code chart
Blue 6
Grey 8
Black 0
Orange x1000
Brown 1%

680 x1000 = 0.68 mega ohm 1% tolerance

-----------------------------------

example
Blue 6
Grey 8
Black 0
Black x1
Brown 1%

0,68 kilo ohms
