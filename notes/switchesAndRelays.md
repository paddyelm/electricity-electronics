# Swithes and Relays

## Switches

Double poll or double throw switches are switches that can connect two different circuts.

You can even get twenty poll switches.

A on off switch is a single poll switch. Also called a push on push off.

Momentary switches only closes the circuit on press and once you let go it opens the circuit. That order matters, press close, let go open.

For the two switches in the kit, the common pin ae the middle pins. Then you press the button or throw close you move clockwise from the common pin, that pin will be you connecting pin. There are no connections to the other pins, the ones anticlockwise from the common pin.

## Relays

Uses a coil to throw switches with a magnetic field.
If specific voltage is given to a relay it will throw specfic switches within itself.

The one in the kit is a double throw 5 volt relay. Don't use a 9v on this, it will break it. Its rating is up to 10 amps

### pins

normally the two at the back are for the coil, and the three in the front are for the switches.

You can use a multimeter to make sure.
Using the resistance mode, he discovers that our kit relay has resistance on the outer pins of the row of three pins. Therefore the front three is where the coil lies, and the outer pins of those there are how you connect to the coil.

Then to find the "common" pin of the switch, he say is most likely the middle pin of the three. He checks for resistance on that middle pin and the looks for the "closed" pin which will show 0 ohms or a really low resistance. The other "open" will not show any resistance reading at all, you should see the default of the multimeter 0L or in my case 1.

### Rating

The ratings on relays or normally for the contacts on the switch and coil. Its rating is in amps and voltage.

The current limitation is to prevent arching, which can melt metal.
