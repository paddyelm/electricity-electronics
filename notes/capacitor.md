# Capacitors

Capacitors have a number system in order do gauge the units in pico farads.

Example 104

is 10 followed by 4 zeros.
100 000 pico farads or 100 nano farads or 0.1 micro farads

capacitors symbols can look like switches

-||-

but the easier more distinctive capacitor symbol:
-|(-

where the left straight line would be the positive lead and the curved line would be negative.

Here is a image indicating the negative lead of the capacitor

## capacitor ratings

Caps are rating in volts.
It is due to the insulator, the breakdown voltage is the rating voltage. The voltage that is high enough to burn out the insulator and jump the insulator gap.
