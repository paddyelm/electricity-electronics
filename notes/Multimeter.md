# Multimeter #

## measuring resistance ##
You can't measure resistance on a live circuit, it will give a incorrect reading.

Make sure to set the meter in the ohm section of the multimeter.
Set the black lead in the COM input & the red lead in the input that has the ohm symbol.
The leads have a resistance of 1 ohm each so if you read 23 ohms, it will actually be 21 ohms.
When measuring accross a resistor and the reading gives a 1, that means the resistance is higher than the setting on the multimeter. You need to move it up to the next ohm range.

## measuring voltage ##

Make sure the circuit is live.
Make sure to set the meter in the V and line with dashed line below for direct current or V~ for AC section of the multimeter.
Set the black lead in the COM input & the red lead in the input that has the V symbol.
