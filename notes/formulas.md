# Formulas

## ohms law

I = V/R

---

## Power

W = VI

---

## Resistance

### Resistance in parallel

R = (R1\*R2)/(R1 + R2)

more than two resisters in parrallel:

1/Rt = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 .... + 1/Rn

### Resistance in series

R = R1+ R2...

---

## Capacitance

### Capacitors in series

Ct = (C1\*C2)/(C1+C2)

1/Ct = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + ... + 1/Cn

### Capacitors in parrallel

Ct = C1 + C2 +....
